# Hi there, I'm Arkadeep Nag!

## Developer | Researcher

I work on autonomous and intelligent systems, with a focus on how learning-based models interact with real software and hardware constraints. My interests span large language models, continuous-state decision making, low-level systems, and embedded and robotics software.

My work involves building scalable and reliable systems, exploring operating system internals, and designing AI-driven components that are intended to function outside controlled environments. I care about correctness, performance, and long-term maintainability, and I prefer research-oriented engineering over short-lived demos.

My long-term direction is centered on embodied intelligence, where machine learning, control theory, and hardware-aware software come together to build autonomous machines that can generalize across environments.
